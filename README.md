# HYBRID PASSWORD CRACKER
The Password Cracking Tool utilizes dictionary and brute-force attacks to crack passwords efficiently. It features multiprocessing for faster attempts, allows user customization of character sets and lengths, and includes progress-saving functionality.

The two main techniques used by this password cracking application to effectively recover lost or forgotten passwords are dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks. By using a prepared wordlist, the dictionary attack enables users to identify matches for popular passwords rapidly. The brute-force assault technique ensures thorough coverage for more complicated passwords by producing every conceivable combination of specified characters within a user-defined length range.

# Important characteristics consist of:
Custom Character Sets: The user can choose from a range of character sets, which include numerals, punctuation, lowercase, uppercase, and combinations of all of these.
Configurable Length: By setting a minimum and maximum password length, users can customize the attack to match the password's difficulty.
Support for Multiprocessing: The program makes use of multiprocessing to take advantage of many CPU cores, greatly accelerating the brute-force assault procedure.
Users can improve usability and efficiency by having the option to store their progress and resume the attack at a later time.
Time Limit Option: To avoid consuming too many resources, users can halt the attack after a predetermined amount of time by configuring the time limit.
